E-Commerce Architecture on AWS – Order Management Project
Overview
This project outlines the architecture of an e-Commerce application deployed on AWS with a serverless and scalable approach. The application allows users to place orders via mobile and web platforms, with a backend built using AWS services like Cognito, API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, Step Functions, Kinesis, and more.

Technology Stack
Frontend: Hosted on Amazon S3 and served via Amazon CloudFront
Authentication: Managed using AWS Cognito
Backend: Implemented with AWS Lambda (microservices architecture)
API Management: Amazon API Gateway (Secured single entry point)
Database: Amazon DynamoDB (NoSQL)
Workflow Orchestration: AWS Step Functions (for order processing)
Data Streaming & Analytics: Amazon Kinesis, S3, Athena, QuickSight
Search Indexing: Amazon OpenSearch
Machine Learning: Amazon SageMaker (for data insights)
Architecture Components
1. User Authentication & Authorization
AWS Cognito manages user registration, authentication, and authorization.
Users can log in via mobile and web platforms.
2. Content Delivery & Hosting
Amazon CloudFront distributes static and dynamic content with low latency.
S3 Bucket hosts static content like the e-commerce website, HTML, JavaScript, and images.
Requests are routed based on content type:
Static Requests → S3
Dynamic Requests → API Gateway
3. Microservices & API Gateway
The application follows a microservices architecture with AWS Lambda functions managed by API Gateway:

Inventory Service: Fetches available product inventory.
Cart Service: Manages product addition/removal from the cart.
Order Service: Handles order placement, cancellation, and returns.
Search Service: Provides search results using Amazon OpenSearch.
4. Order Processing with AWS Step Functions
Orders trigger Step Functions, orchestrating multiple AWS services:
New Order
Cancel Order
Return Order
Lambda functions invoke Step Functions to ensure smooth workflow execution.
5. Database Layer – Amazon DynamoDB
Entities Stored:
Products
Inventory
Cart
Orders
AWS Cognito handles users and orders, so they are not stored separately in DynamoDB.
6. Real-time Data Streaming & Analytics
DynamoDB Streams → Amazon Kinesis Data Stream
Kinesis Firehose writes data to Amazon S3
Athena queries stored data for insights
QuickSight visualizes order and sales data
Amazon SageMaker applies ML models for predictive analytics
7. Search & Indexing
Kinesis Firehose feeds data into Amazon OpenSearch
OpenSearch indexes data for quick product searches
Deployment & Setup
Prerequisites
AWS CLI installed and configured
Terraform / AWS CDK for infrastructure automation (optional)
Node.js / Python (for Lambda functions)
Steps to Deploy
Set up AWS Cognito for user authentication
Configure S3 & CloudFront for hosting
Deploy API Gateway & Lambda Functions
Set up DynamoDB tables for product, inventory, cart, and order management
Configure AWS Step Functions for order processing workflows
Set up Kinesis Data Streams & Firehose for real-time analytics
Integrate OpenSearch for product search capabilities
Deploy monitoring & logging with AWS CloudWatch
Future Enhancements
Implement AWS Fargate instead of Lambda for high-volume workloads
Add AI-driven recommendations with SageMaker
Use Amazon RDS for relational data storage if required
Optimize API caching with AWS CloudFront
